# audio-visualizer-wallpaper-edited
This Lively audio visualizer sample project by Dabjulmaros. His project decided to edit and add more settings Kaktus56

The author of the original wallpaper is Dabjulmaros

I really like them and have been using them for a very long time. But I didn't have enough standard settings. First of all, I wanted to add an image to the background. So I looked for other wallpapers. And using the example of another author NowbodyAnybody 
https://github.com/NowbodyAnybody/Lively-Audio-Visualizer

I combined the best of the two projects.
